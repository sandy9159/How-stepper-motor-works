Hello friends

In our today’s known modern world motors are playing key role to drive our technology.

Different types of motor are there in market all are divided on basis of there construction, application, working principle etc.

In this article we are going to learn some basics of stepper motors.

As name suggest there is something like steps involved in working of this types of motors that we’ll learn further in the post.

We’ll also see how stepper motor works , and its construction details in this post.


## Working principle of stepper motor

Basically stepper motors are brushless DC motors, normally a permanent magnet rotor placed in between of stator winding.

Stator winding then energize step by step in a sequential way so it get magnetize and force rotor to align with the magnetic field of stator coil.

in this way rotor begin rotate in small steps, due to this behavior the motor gets its name “stepper motor”

As we can see now by controlling the stator winding generations sequence we can precisely control the position of rotor without any position feedback system.

this quality of stepper motor makes is best suitable to be used were high precision motion is required like CNC machines.
